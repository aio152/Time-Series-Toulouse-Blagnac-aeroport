# Overview
We have a database on the daily passenger traffic (arrivals and departures) at the airport of Toulouse Blagnac since January 1993. The objective was to explain the impact of the events of September 11, 2001, on the number of passengers and the losses associated with that event. Finally, we aim to build an ARIMA model to predict the number of passengers in the upcoming months
